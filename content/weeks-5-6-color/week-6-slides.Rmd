# 2. Reading Discussion

---

Based on the readings from last week, what are some primary considerations for choosing colors when designing data visualizations?

Let's add ideas together here: https://jamboard.google.com/d/1MJn8uJizaGONSIq6QLuTwc1jdTlbrtdKFdX12ATXNms/edit?usp=sharing

# Reading Discussion

Based on these considerations, which color choice do you think best communicates the story in the data?

# 3. Beyond base colors

### What are other options besides base R colors?


.pull-left[

One popular set of functions that come with `ggplot` is

`scale_*_brewer` 

Note that * refers to either `fill` or `color`.

- `fill` is usually used with `geom_col`, `geom_bar`, `geom_area`, `geom_tile`
- `color` is usually used with `geom_point` and `geom_line`
]

.pull-right[
 **Qualitative Palette**

```{r fig.height=2}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters, fill=letters))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Accent")
```

Other palette options include: Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Pastel2, Set1, Set2, Set3
]
---

.pull-left[
 **Sequential Palette**

```{r fig.height=2}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters, fill=letters))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_brewer(type="seq", palette = "BuGn", direction=-1)
```

Other colors include: Blues, BuPu, GnBu, Greens, Greys, Oranges, OrRd, PuBu, PuBuGn, PuRd, Purples, RdPu, Reds, YlGn, YlGnBu, YlOrBr, YlOrRd
]

.pull-right[
 **Diverging Palette**

```{r fig.height=2}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters, fill=letters))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_brewer(type="div", palette="PiYG")
```
Other palettes include: BrBG, PRGn, PuOr, RdBu, RdGy, RdYlBu, RdYlGn, Spectral
]

---

### What are other options besides base R colors?

.pull-left[
Another set of more advanced options installed with `ggplot` include:


- `scale_*_viridis_c` - used for continuous data
- `scale_*_viridis_d` - used for discrete data


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=4}
txsamp <- subset(txhousing, city %in%
  c("Houston", "Fort Worth", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Austin"))
d <- ggplot(data = txsamp, aes(x = sales, y = median)) +
   geom_point(aes(colour = city), size=3)

d + scale_colour_viridis_d()
```
See [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) for other color options

]

### What are other options besides base R colors?


You can install and use other color packages such as `tvthemes`, `hrbrthemes`,  `ghibli`, or even `LaCroixColoR`. See 

See https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes/blob/master/type-sorted-palettes.md for a list of R color packages

# Assignment 5: Data Viz Glow Up

Using our previous assignments, choose 1 visualization and redesign them to use some of the color principles and techniques we discussed.

The following represents assignment and grading criteria.

- ☐ Submit a new Rmd that you create from scratch. This must run when knitted.
- ☐ Do not use default ggplot colors. Use base R colors or a package.
- ☐ At least one of your plots must use a custom palette you develop.
- ☐ At least one of your plots must map the color to a numeric dimension.

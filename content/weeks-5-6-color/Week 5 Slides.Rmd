# Reading Discussion

**Read:**
Scherer (2018)
Wilke (2019) 4 and 19

Based on the readings from last week, what are some primary considerations for choosing colors when designing data visualizations?

# Color Blindness Tools

### Color Oracle is a free tool to help you quickly determine what your graphic looks like under different color blindness conditions

At this time, download and install it from https://colororacle.org/

# Colors in R

Given our ability to 

1. Understand what is important in color selection **and**
2. Test whether our color choices are color blind friendly...

How can we use colors in R?

# Colors in R

## Base R Colors

R comes pre-loaded with 657 _named_ colors!

You can also specify _any_ color using a hex code.

(*We had to look into this: In standard #RRGGBB notation, there are 256^3 color combinations available, or 16,777,216*)

Use the command `colors()` to see all the named colors' names and visit http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf to see many of these colors.

## Using Base R Colors

You can simply use the name of the color in quotes.


```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1983)
example_data <- data.frame(letters=LETTERS[1:5], numbers=sample(5:20, 5))
```


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters))+
  geom_col(fill="skyblue")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include = TRUE}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters))+
  geom_col(fill="skyblue")+
  theme_void()
```

## Using Base R Colors

You can simply use the name of the color in quotes, saying which bar you want to fill with which color

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters, fill=letters))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("A" = "skyblue",
                             "B" = "sandybrown",
                             "C" = "sandybrown",
                             "D" = "sandybrown",
                             "E" = "maroon"))+
  theme_void()
```


]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
example_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numbers, y=letters, fill=letters))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("A" = "skyblue",
                             "B" = "sandybrown",
                             "C" = "palegreen1",
                             "D" = "peachpuff1",
                             "E" = "maroon"))+

This graph and the previous graph both use `fill`. What is the difference between the two usages?

This maps the color to the `geom`etry - simply applying it to *all* the shapes.

## Using Base R Colors

`scale_fill_manual()` allows you to manually select the `fill` colors.  

Here, we are setting the values using a **named vector**. `c()` creates a vector where the name "A" is equal to "skyblue" and so on.


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("A" = "skyblue",
                             "B" = "sandybrown",
                             "C" = "palegreen1",
                             "D" = "peachpuff1",
                             "E" = "maroon"))
```

Note: a vector is similar to a single `c`olumn of data in a table.

                             "B" = "sandybrown",
                             "C" = "palegreen1",
                             "D" = "peachpuff1",
                             "E" = "maroon"))+
  theme_void()

# DIY Color Palette

Access the **Week 4 - Color Activities.Rmd** file.  
Let's work together to build a custom palette!

<!-- Note 1: This was designed to be a whole class activity 
It can be code along-style

Note 2: It is more than likely this could be assigned as homework and continued in next class
-->

# 4. Next steps

For the next week:

- Begin on Mini Project 1
- Complete Week 5 Color Activities

To check out:

- Looking ahead, wou will complete a final project that involves developing a visualization with your own data or a data set of your choice. The goal of this project is to create a publication-ready visualization that demonstrates what you have learned throughout the course. **What data are you interested in using?**

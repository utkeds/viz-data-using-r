# Thanks for completing the pre-course survey

- *Concerns*: no experience, time management, unfamiliarity with coding 
- *Favorite classes*: enthusiasm of instructor, real-world applications
- *Modes of communication*: Email/Canvas, Slack
- *Modality*: intentionally designing the course to be meaningful and useful to you
- *Prior experiences*: none at all, a little bit for a project, a handful with more experience
- *Your random facts*: super interesting!

# Your turn!

Complete the survey below.
When you are done, we will look at the responses and discuss the results!

# What's wrong with this viz? (1/5)

Look at the image and share what you think is wrong (or right) with the visualization

<!-- 
Suggestions for discussion: 

COLORS: All are a form of blue for no apparent reason, difficult contrast between colors, same category has different colors

SHAPE/SIZE: difficult to tell which slices are larger in left plot 
kil
VALUES: raw values instead of percentages shown

Tip: these would be better as bar charts or faceted line charts. 
-->

# What's wrong with this viz? (2/5)


<img src="https://i.redd.it/232ga4fs92t41.jpg" height="500px">

<!-- 
Suggestions for discussion:

The major issue is the axes labels

VALUES: What do these values mean? They seem like percentages. Percentages of what? We need a y-axis label

FLAGS: Does everyone know all of these countries? Flags are clever, but could be difficult for many readers.

# What's wrong with this viz? (3/5)

<!-- 
Suggestions for discussion:

Yes looks bigger than No because of check mark.

Use of two negatives makes this confusing.

Tip: use color rather than an additional image to highlight winner or other meaningful data

# What's wrong with this viz? (4/5)


![](https://www.datapine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Truncated-Y-Axis-Data-Visualizations-Designed-To-Mislead.jpg)

<!-- 
Suggestions for discussion:

Lack of zero axis makes it look like there is a major difference but the difference would mostly disappear if there was a zero axis start.

# Your First R Project

---

# R Projects

- R projects make organizing and accessing your work easy.
- With R projects, you can move a project within your computer or from computer to computer and never worry about breaking file paths.
- You can share a project with another person and it should work with no issues!

---


# Your First R Project

For your first R project, you will create a project that you can use throughout the course. 

Today, you will create:

--

- An R project somewhere on your computer called something like "STEM 591 - Data Visualization in R"
--

- A .Rproj file that opens R studio for your specific project
--

- A Week 1 folder
--

  - We will put a data set and R script in this folder when you make Your First Data Visualization
  
  <!-- Begin hands-on walkthrough of creating an R project -->
---

# Your First Data Visualization

# Your First Data Visualization

We will access an R script that will

--
- install key R packages using `install.packages()`,
--

- load key packages using `library()`,
--

- load a data set using `read_csv()`,
--

- and build a very simple visualization using `ggplot()`!

--

Plus a special surprise!

# Homework

.pull-left[
## Read

**Cairo (2019), Chapter 1**
**Healy (2018), Chapter 1**

Guiding Questions:
1. What are some characteristics of good data visualizations?
1. What are some characteristics of bad data visualizations?
1. Think back to the "What's wrong with this viz" activity. How is it related to Cairo's 5 steps to reading a data visualization?

## Work Through: 
<small>
**Schmidt & Boyd (2020), 2.1-2.10**

These sections provide a basic overview of preparing and cleaning data in R. This should serve as a useful R crash course (or review) and cover some important tasks and functions we will be doing in each class.

You should follow the examples provided as you read the text. Note any confusing functions, issues, or errors so we may discuss them in class.

If needed, refer to Schmidt & Boyd (2020) Chapter 1 (R Basics).</small>

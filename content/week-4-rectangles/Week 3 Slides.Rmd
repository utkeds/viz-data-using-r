## Simple text  
## Large numbers  
## BAN (big ass numbers)

--

Useful for simple or important numbers, especially when you do not have many to show or if you want to highlight a specific number

## 100% Stacked Bar Chart

--
To show percent of categories **within groups**

---

## Scatter Plot

--

Showing the **relationship** between two things, especially (but not necessarily) between two numeric values

---

# Name That Chart

--

## Heatmap

--

Useful for visualizing **tabular data**, such as correlations

--

What do the colors of this chart signal to you?  
Does the color choice aid or impede mental processing?

---

# Name That Chart

.pull-left-margin[

]


--

## Pie chart

--

It is used to show a **proportion** of 100%.

--

They can be **useful IF** there are 3 or less slices.

--

Often poorly used. When in doubt - use a bar chart!

## Slope Graph

--

This is useful for **comparing two time periods** and showing change in some value

---

# Name That Chart

--

## Area Chart

--

Like a line chart, this is useful for **showing change over time**.

# R Fundamental: `summarize`

Summarize each group to fewer rows using `dplyr` from the `tidyverse` family of packages

---
# R Fundamental: `summarize`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidykids)
library(tidyverse)
```

.pull-left[
Here is the `tidykids` dataset.

```{r}
tidykids %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(1:4)
```
]

.pull-right[
We can use `summarize` to group by a column and combine other columns
]

# R Fundamental: `summarize`

.pull-left[
Here is the `tidykids` dataset for PK12ed.

```{r include=FALSE}
tidykids <- tidykids %>%
  filter(variable == "PK12ed") %>%
  select(1:4)
```


```{r}
tidykids %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(raw)) %>%
  head(10)
```
]

.pull-right[
In this example, we:

- Used `tidykids` *and then*
- `Group`ed by year *and then*
- Took the `mean` of each year

# R Fundamental: `summarize`

.pull-left[

```{r}
tidykids %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(raw)) %>%
  head(10)
```
]

.pull-right[
In this example, we:

- Used `tidykids` *and then*
- `Group`ed by state *and then*
- Took the `mean` of each year

# R Fundamental: `summarize`

.pull-left[

### We can use a number of different functions. The most useful are:

sum()

Center: mean(), median()

Spread: sd(), IQR(), mad()

Range: min(), max(), quantile()

Count: n(), n_distinct()

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
tidykids %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(the_mean = mean(raw),
            a_median = median(raw),
            and_a_min = min(raw)) %>%
  head(10)
```

# R Fundamental: `summarize` code along

Let's work to summarize `tidykids` and then build some bar plots using `ggplot`!

# Assignment 2: College Majors

Work with a partner to explore the **College Majors** data set that begins Assignment 2.

## Driver & Navigator

.pull-left[

### Driver

- Share your screen and display you R Studio
- You type, run code, and follow the navigator
- Contribute your ideas as well!
]

.pull-right[
### Navigator

- Take charge of the analysis
- Tell the driver what to type
- Listen to your partner's ideas as well!

## Introduction
  
In this exercise, you will use the `penguins` dataset from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica to create a professional table summarizing penguin measurements.
You will wrangle the data, calculate summary statistics, and use the {gt} package to create and style a publication-ready table.

## Research Question

What are the average body and bill measurements for different penguin species across the islands in the Palmer Archipelago?

## Instructions

1. **Load Required Packages and Dataset**
   - Load the `palmerpenguins` package
   - Load the `tidyverse` package
   - Load the `gt` package
   - Examine the `penguins` dataset

2. **Data Wrangling**:
   - In a code chunk you create below, do the following:
     - Group the data by `species` and `island`
     - Calculate the mean `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, and `body_mass_g` for each group using `summarize()`
     - Remember to use `na.rm = TRUE` in your `mean()` functions to handle missing values

3. **Create a Basic Table**:
   - Pipe your wrangled data into `gt()`
   - Add a title using `tab_header()` with the title "Palmer Penguins: Average Measurements by Species and Island"
   - Add a subtitle "Data from Palmer Station, Antarctica"

4. **Style Your Table**:
   - Use `tab_spanner()` to group the bill measurement columns under a label "Bill Measurements (mm)"
   - Add a footnote to the `body_mass_g` column noting "Body mass measured in grams" using `tab_footnote()`
   - Use `tab_options()` to set `data_row.padding` to `px(5)`

5. **Reflection**:
   - Which species-island combination has the largest average body mass?
   - What differences do you notice in bill measurements across species?
   - How does the table format help communicate the data compared to viewing the raw tibble?

tidyverse

What is tidyverse?

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science.

Some of the key packages include:

{ggplot2}
geom_point()
{dplyr}
filter()
{tidyr}
pivot_longer()

tidyverse packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

```{r first_ten_sum}
first_ten_sum <- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
```

The sum of the first ten counting numbers is `r first_ten_sum`.

This is why it is so effective for data science.

**An Example Data Frame - starwars**

```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(1:5) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

# R Fundamentals

What the heck is `%>%` ?

# R Fundamentals - What the heck is `%>%` ?

The pipe operator `%>%` connects functions together into a *chain* of step-by-step commands. It can be translated as **and then**.

Below, R is written on the left and an English translation is written on the right:

.pull-left[

### R

```{r, echo=TRUE, EVAL = FALSE, warning=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, height) %>%
  glimpse()
  
```

]

--

.pull-right[

### English

1. Take the starwars data set *and then*  
2. `select` the name and height columns *and then*  
3. `view` the result in R Studio

### `mutate` Challenge
1. How many columns do we expect?
2. What does each line do?
3. Can we simplify it?


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
starwars %>%
  mutate(one = height^2) %>%
  mutate(two = height*mass) %>%
  mutate(hair_color = ifelse(is.na(hair_color),
                             "unknown", hair_color))
```

# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R

# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
`ggplot` offers a "grammar of graphics" for building data visualization in R.

Data visualizations are built in **layers**.

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars)
```



]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]


---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Data is always the first layer:

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]

---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Data is then **mapped** to various **aes**thetics (x, y, fill, shape, etc.):

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name))
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Then, we add **geom**etries, which are the shapes and visual encodings:

```{r, eval = TRUE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name))+
geom_col()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can change the **aes**thetics by **fill**iling them with colors.

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=skin_color))+
geom_col()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can change the **geom**etries, too:

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=skin_color))+
geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
`fill` is for bars while `color` is for points and lines

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, color=skin_color,
                     shape=hair_color))+
geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can add other layers. Let's go wild and make a *bad plot*:

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=mass, color=skin_color,
                     shape=hair_color))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,200,100))+
  labs(x="Name", y="Height", title="A Wild Starwars Chart")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# `tidykids` Scavenger Hunt

## Work alone or with a partner to answer the questions with `tidykids`

File: tidykids Scavenger Hunt

# Office hours, asking for help, and common solutions

## Asking for help

1. What question you're working on
2. The code you are running (sharing screen/taking a screen shot is helpful!)
3. The error you are receiving
4. What steps you've taken to solve the problem yourself

# Homework

<small>
.pull-left[

## Reading

**Knafflic, Chapter 2**  
Knafflic refers to "graphs" and "visual displays of information". How did Cairo refer to them?

When should one use a scatterplot, a stacked bar chart, or a large number value? 

## Work Through

**Healy, Chapter 3**

This will help you better understand `ggplot` for data visualization.

(no discussion question for this one)

## Assignment 1: `tidykids` visualization

Using the `tidykids` dataset, you will make a simple bar chart showing which category of spending per chuld has been highest, on average, for Tennessee.

# Today's Class

For today's class, we are going to do something different.

We are going to meet in gather.town to become familiar with the environment we will use for our final presentations.

<!-- # gather.town -->

<!-- gather.town is an 8-bit virtual communication environment. It is like Zoom with the ability to navigate in and out of different conversations with different people - all in an interactive environment. -->

# What is this?

.pull-left[

<img src="joydivisionplot.jpg" height="400px"/>

]

.pull-right[
- This is the cover to Joy Division's 1979 album *Unknown Pleasures*
- The plot depicts the radio emissions of a rotating neutron star.
- Each line is a pulse given when it turns
- Together, it is a **distribution** of emissions from different pulses
- This visualization - or the album cover - has reached iconic status and can often be seen on clothing

# Histograms and other distributions

What do you think the following graphs show?

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

]

# The classics

Wait...where is `ggplot`?

<!-- Students may not have seen some of base R's plot functions. Now is a good chance to introduce these two and what the $ means.

Reference: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html
-->

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

]

---

# The classics

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]


---

# A (relative) newcomer

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_density()
```

---

# Histograms vs. Density plots

.pull-left[

### Histograms

- How it works: *bin* and count observations
- Key consideration: How many bins (defaults are often but not always suitable)
- Historically important, but somewhat replaced by newer techniques

]

.pull-right[

### Density plots

- How it works: uses fancy math to _estimate_ a curve that represents the distribution of the data
- Key consideration: avoiding representing made-up data points
- Can be a little hard to straightforwardly interpret

]

---

# Multiple distributions: Histograms and box plots

You can easily split out the plot with `fill`

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, position = "identity", alpha=.6)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]

---

# Multiple plots; Overlapping densities

*set alpha*

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_density(alpha = .25)
```

---

# Multiple plots; Violin plots

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_violin()
```

---

# Density and Ridgeline Plots

Sometimes you want to know the shape of your distribution, but you do not want a histogram.

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_density()
```

Note:
Plotting a histogram and density curve together takes a bit more work:


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
geom_histogram(binwidth=100, colour="black", 
               aes(y=..density..))+
stat_function(fun=dnorm,
                         color="red",
                         args=list(mean=mean(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                             na.rm=TRUE), 
                                   sd=sd(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                         na.rm=TRUE)))

```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

We can easily get a bit fancier with the `ggridges` package:

```{r, fig.height=5}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=island))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

How can ridgeline plots be useful?

.pull-left[

Imagine a **long** dataset like this:

```{r}
penguins_long <- penguins %>%
  rownames_to_column("id") %>%
  pivot_longer(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g,
               names_to="stat_type", values_to="stat")

head(penguins_long, n=5)
```

]

.pull_right[

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(penguins_long, aes(x=stat, y=stat_type))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

]

# Activity - Pilot and Navigator

You will work in small groups (breakout rooms) where one student is a pilot and the other students are navigators:

- The **pilot** will share their screen and type the code
- The **navigators** will tell the pilot what to type (the pilot can help, too)

Access the Week 15 Distributions Activity.Rmd document; submit with both members' names.

<!-- Note: This instructional material is shorter in case you need time to discuss the project in class -->

# Mapping

- Chloropleth 
- Lat/lon points (street map code along)

Check the _Optional Module (Mapping)_ module in Canvas

---

# Logistics

**Final Project Submissions**
You will upload your knitted .HTML file to Canvas. You will also place your three visualizations into a PDF, PPT, or Google Slide deck and upload it to Canvas. Here is a useful code snippet for good slide-sized output:

```{r}
ggsave(plot=last_plot(), width=10, height=8, file="your_file_name.jpg")
```

**Poster Presentation Event**

Session 1 - Half the class will be presenters in online booths while the other half, along with instructors/special guests, will visit presenters and discuss the visualizations. 

Presenters should discuss the story of the data, using the visualizations as aids. 
Presenters should only speak for 1-2 minutes and take time to answer any questions or interact with the other attendees who appear in their booth.
This presentation style mimics actual poster presentations that occur at many conferences.
During Session 2, roles will switch. Presenters will be attendees and student attendees will become presenters.

In order to make using this virtual space as easy as possible, all materials must be uploaded to canvas by Friday, 5/5. Your materials will then be placed in booths in gather.town.

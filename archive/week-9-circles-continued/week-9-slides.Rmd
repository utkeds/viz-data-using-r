# Dots, Lollipops, and Barbells

Dot plots, lollipop charts, and barbell charts are types of charts you can make with circles. However, they can be seen more like bar charts than scatter charts.

Look at the following examples. How does the display of information change the story?
When do you think each plot could be used?

# Dot Plots
.pull-left[

A dot plot simply replaces a bar with a dot. It is situated at the end point of where the bar would have ended.

An advantage of a dotplot is that there is less visual clutter. Lots of white space with a little color (the dot) is much easier to look at and tells the same story.

# Lollipop Plots

This is almost the same as the dot plot and even a little closer to the bar chart. The dot indicates the value while the thin line allows you to see the distance from the 0-axis.

# Barbell Plots

.pull-left[

Whereas the previous two plots are alternatives to bar charts, the barbell (or dumbbell) plot is something else entirely. 

It allows you to plot multiple subcategories of a category and the line between the dots allows you to estimate a gap.

# How do we make these in R? 

## It's easy!

```{r include=FALSE}
recent_grads <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv") 

grad_data <- recent_grads %>%
  group_by(Major_category) %>%
  summarize(Men = mean(Men),
            Women = mean(Women),
            Overall = mean(Total)) %>%
  filter(Major_category %in% c("Business", "Education", "Engineering"))
```

# From Bar to Dot

With a bar plot, the magic is in `geom_col`:

```{r fig.height=4}
grad_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Overall, y=Major_category))+
  geom_col()
```

---

# From Bar to Dot

We can simply use `geom_point` and increase its size

```{r fig.height=4}
grad_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Overall, y=Major_category))+
  geom_point(size=5)
```
---
# From Dot to Lollipop

If we wanted to add a line, we can use `geom_linerange()`. We will call it before `geom_point` so it is under the circle. `geom_linerange()`'s aesthethics that an xmin/xmax or ymin/ymax.

> Shapes appear in the order they are specified in the code

```{r, fig.height=4}
grad_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Overall, y=Major_category))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=0, xmax=Overall))+
  geom_point(size=5)
```
---
# From Bar to Barbell

There are a few ways to make a barbell plot. The simplest is if each column is a set of observations. This is not "tidy" data, but it is one way to do it:

.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE}
grad_data %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

]

.pull-right[

First, let's draw our lines from Men to Women

```{r fig.height=3}
grad_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=Major_category))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=Women, xmax=Men))
```


]

# From Bar to Barbell

There are a few ways to make a barbell plot. The simplest is if each column is a set of observations. This is not "tidy" data, but it is one way to do it:

.pull-left[

Now, let's plot each column and give it a color.

```{r fig.height=3}
grad_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=Major_category))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=Women, xmax=Men))+
  geom_point(aes(x=Men), color="purple", size=3)+
  geom_point(aes(x=Women), color="orange", size=3)+
  geom_point(aes(x=Overall), color="grey70", size=3)+
  xlab("Average")
  
```

]

.pull-right[

One downside of using "wide" data is that there is no legend that can be easily added.

A better alternative is to make the data "long".

]
---
# From Bar to Barbell

.pull-left[

```{r}
grad_data %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
grad_data_long <- grad_data %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Men:Overall),
               names_to = "category", values_to="avg")

grad_data_long %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
]
---
# From Bar to Barbell

We can easily add the points from this data.
```{r fig.height=3}
grad_data_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg, y=Major_category, color=category))+
  geom_point(size=3)
```

However, getting the line requires a bit more preparation.

---
# From Bar to Barbell

What we want to do is, for each major, find the minimum value and the maximum value but exclude the overall value, since we just want to draw a line between men and women.


```{r}
grad_data_long2 <- grad_data_long %>%
  group_by(Major_category) %>%
  mutate(min = min(avg[category != "Overall"]),
         max = max(avg[category != "Overall"]))

grad_data_long2

```

`max(avg[category != "Overall"]))` means:

- Take the maximum value of the "avg" column where "category" doesn't equal (`!=`) "Overall".

---
# From Bar to Barbell

Now we are ready!

```{r fig.height=4}
grad_data_long2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg, y=Major_category, color=category))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=min, xmax=max), color="grey70")+
  geom_point(size=3)

```

There is almost no line between men and women in business. What does that tell us?

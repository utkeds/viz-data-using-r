# STEM 591 Final Project Plans

In groups, briefly (2 min. max per person) discuss your plans:

- What data you are planning to use
- What plans (if any) you have for the three visualizations you will create
- What challenges you anticipate or questions you have

Plan for one person to share with the group any common anticipated challenges or questions.

# Design a Data Visualization Checklist

### Given a whole semesters' worth of data viz knowhow, how would you assess a data visualization? Which principles and practices would you want to see employed?

Work with a small group to develop a checklist or rubric that can be used to evaluate any data visualization **based on the principles and practices** we have read this semester.

1. One student should make a copy of [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XwzuyJ1MH04AKo_a-6TdwWZNGnRTDHPQcIrxvbJtlI/copy) to get started.
2. Share it with your group members and myself (jrosen8@utk.edu)
3. Work together to create at least 5 criteria for evaluation. Define each criteria clearly.
4. For each criteria you create, cite the appropriate reading (e.g., Cairo, Wilke, Knafflic, etc.). 
5. For each criteria you create, decide how that individual criteria will be assessed: checklist, 1-3, 0-4. 
 - What do numeric ratings mean? E.g, does 1 mean "poor", "missing", "needs improvement" or something more in-depth?
6. If possible, group your criteria together under headings, e.g., "Information", "Layout", etc.

# STEM 591 Final Project 

You will select a **data set of your choice**. You will explore, analyze, and summarize your data set, creating **three data visualizations** that tell a story about this data. You may create three separate charts or build an infographic, or any combination.

You will upload your data source and Rmd file. You will also place your three visualizations into a PDF, PPT, or Google Slide deck.

On May 8, we will meet in a virtual space called **gather.town** and you will participate in a poster presentation event.

All materials must be uploaded to canvas by 12:00 pm on Friday, May 5.

These will then be placed in "booths" on **gather.town**. A **gather.town** instruction video is forthcoming.

# STEM 591 Final Project

### How will you be graded on this? I'm glad you asked!

In addition to a checklist of basic requirements (e.g., code can be reproduced, all 3 data visualizations are different, etc.), I will select criteria to evaluate your data visualizations from today's activity! I will choose criteria from different groups and implement or adapt the ratings you created, as well.

I will provide an updated project rubric before our next class.

# STEM 591 Final Project

### Next steps

In the *Elaborated Final Project Plans* Discussion, please:

- Share a _rendered_ HTML file that you will use for your final project. 
- In it, include the following four sections (using level 2 headings; ##):
  - Which data set you plan to use. 
  - Code to load the data into R and code to explore the data (at a very high level - the goal being to understand the dimensions of the data, variable types, and number of rows and columns); if you do not have access to your data yet, this can be "template" code for when you do, but please work to gain access to the data if at all possible. 
  - Which visualizations you plan to create. 
  - What questions you have or what challenges you anticipate. 
  
  
This is not meant to be perfect; it is to be used for a conversation next week!

# Design with `ggplot`

There are many ways to better design your data visualizations in `ggplot`.

A key way is to ensure you employ principles of color, text, and shape to make your data visualization as readable as possible.

Additionally, we'll explore:

- composite plots
- faceting
- annotations

---

# Compound Figures with `patchwork`

Rather than using a design element *within* a plot, what if we wanted to connect multiple plots together?

We can use the `patchwork` package!

Let's begin with two separate plots.

---

# Compound Figures with `patchwork`

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
flipper_hist_2
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r include=FALSE}
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
mass_flipper
```
]

---
# Compound Figures with `patchwork`

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(patchwork)
flipper_hist_2 + mass_flipper
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
combined_plot_1 <- flipper_hist_2 + mass_flipper
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
combined_plot_1
```


]

---

# Compound Figures with `patchwork`

To add two plots next to each other, we use `+` or `|`

To add two plots on top of each other, we use `/`


We can also set different widths and heights using:

```
+ plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1),
heights = c(2, 1))
```

> This means the first plot is 2x the size of the second.

There are many other ways we can control the layout. I recommend checking out the [`patchwork` documentation on controlling layout](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/layout.html).
---

# Compound Figures with `patchwork`

Here is an example using R's built-in `mtcars` data:

.pull-left[
```{r include=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 1')

p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 2')

p3 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(hp, wt, colour = mpg)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 3')

p4 <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_bar(aes(gear)) + 
  facet_wrap(~cyl) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 4')

p1a <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp, colour = mpg, size = wt)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 1a')
```

```{r}
patchwork_example <- p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + 
  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1),
              guides = 'collect' ) +
   plot_annotation(
     title = 'The surprising truth about mtcars')
```

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
patchwork_example
```

# Small Multiples with `facet_wrap`

For this example, we will use the `palmerpenguins` package.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)

flipper_hist_1 <- 
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Distribution of flipper lengths")+
  theme_minimal()


flipper_hist_2 <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  facet_wrap(~species)+
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Distribution of flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Distribution of flipper lengths")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


.pull-left[

No Small Multiples

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
flipper_hist_1
```


]

.pull-right[

Small Multiples

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
flipper_hist_2
```

]

# Small Multiples with `facet_wrap`

## How did we do it?

To create, the regular plot, we used the following code

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") + 
  # position = "identity" this overlaps 
  # rather than stacks the bars
  scale_fill_manual(values = 
          c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Distribution of flipper lengths")+
  theme_minimal()
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
flipper_hist_1
```


]

---

# Small Multiples with `facet_wrap`

Now we can use `facet_wrap` to make small multiples

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = 
          c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Distribution of flipper lengths")+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(~species)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
flipper_hist_2
```


]

# Small Multiples with `facet_wrap`

Main Arguments:
`facet_wrap`(~facet_variables, nrow, ncol, scales)

<!-- 
Teaching note: explain the following 
- facet_variable, we can facet by one or more variables. With two variables, we simply use the + sign 

 -nrow specifies how many rows 
-n col specifies how many columns 

-scales can be "free", "free_x", or "free_y" and allows the axes to vary based on the facet

                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +

       title = "Distribution of flipper lengths")+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=3, scales="free_y")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
flipper_hist_3 <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +

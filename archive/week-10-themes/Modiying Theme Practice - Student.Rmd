## The Data

Today, we will take a break from educational data so we can focus on coding. We will use the fabulous `palmerpenguins` package, which contains data on penguin sex and species from several islands in Antarctica.

## The Starter Plot

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = "purple",
                                "Gentoo" = "cyan4"))
```

## The Target

![](target_plot.png)

### Plot Tips:
- `scales::comma_format()`
- `labs`
- Don't forget about `hjust` and `vjust`
- Font size on axis and legend titles is 10
- Axis titles are italic
- The plot title is bold
- The major grid lines are `"grey90"`
- The plot caption is `"cyan4"`
- Both the title and caption positions are aligned to the plot
- The legend position is set using `legend.position = c(x, y),` where x and y range from 0-1.
- When you are done, save your plot like so:

`ggsave(last_plot(), width=10, height=6, file="penguin_plot.png")`

## Let's goooooooo!

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = "purple",
                                "Gentoo" = "cyan4"))
```

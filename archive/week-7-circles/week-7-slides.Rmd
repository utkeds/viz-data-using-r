# Scatterplots in R

Scatterplots are quite simple to create in R. For today's examples, we will use the `palmerpenguin` package and its `penguins` data set, which contains measurements for different penguins in Antarctica.

<img src='https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png' height=400px />

```{r include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

---


First, we can use base R to simply plot all the data in a *scatterplot matrix*

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
plot(penguins)
```

This is not super useful, however.

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can make a bivariate (two-variable) scatterplot using `geom_point()`.


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point()
```

---

# Scatterplots in R

We can change the color of all dots simply with `color = `


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point(color="skyblue")
```

---

# Scatterplots in R

We can map the color to the penguin species by using `color` inside of `aes`


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species))+
  geom_point()
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can also map the *shape* to a variable using `shape`


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=sex))+
  geom_point()
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can separate this out by island using `facet_wrap`. This allows us to see very  clear relationships between flipper length and body mass.


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=sex))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~island, nrow=1)
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

All of the colors and shapes can be controlled using `scale_color_manual` and `scale_shape_manual`. See list of shapes [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#polygons).

.pull-left[

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,
                                "Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

# Scatterplots in R


.pull-left[

Scatterplots often are useful for **correlations**. It is possible to display not only the correlation but the slope of a line for each scatterplot. We can add the correlation coefficient with `ggpubr::stat_cor()` and the regression line with `geom_smooth()`

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)
```


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  stat_cor()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  stat_cor()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

# Visualizing Proportions

We will return to scatterplots shorttly. Before doing so, let's talk about proportions. Let's stick with `palmerpenguins` and get the proportion of number of penguins observed per island

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  count()
```

---

# Visualizing Proportions

We can make a proportion by using `mutate` and `prop.table()`:

```{r}
penguin_prop <- penguins %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(proportion = prop.table(n))

penguin_prop
```

---

# Visualizing Proportions

We can visualize this in a few ways. For example, as **stacked bars**:

```{r fig.height=5}
penguin_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=proportion, fill=island))+
  geom_col()
```

---

# Visualizing Proportions

As **side-by-side** bars

```{r fig.height=5}
penguin_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=proportion, fill=island))+
  geom_col(position="dodge")
```

---

# Visualizing Proportions

Or as a **pie chart** using `coord_polar`

```{r fig.height=5}
penguin_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=proportion, fill=island))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)
```

---

# Visualizing Proportions

Let's get a bit fancier:

```{r fig.height=4.5}
penguin_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y=proportion, fill=island))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_text(aes(label=scales::percent(proportion)),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size=5)+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)+
  theme_void()
```

### Reading

Please read and work through [Healy, chapter 5](https://socviz.co/workgeoms.html). Some of this will be review (and it is always good to review) but some will be new and it introduces our next topic: **text**!

Guiding question: As you read about the use of text in `ggplot`, think back to our first weeks of class. According to Cairo, what text should be used and where to aid in reading a visualization?

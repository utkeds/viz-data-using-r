Pasadena Unified School District,2010-01-20T19:08:47Z,8,5,3,0,"PUSD BOARD VOTES TO PLACE PARCEL TAX ON MAY 4 BALLOT Measure Would Protect Schools, Libraries, Arts & Music Facing the most severe reduction in funding from the State of California in its history, the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD) Board of Education voted unanimously to place a local parcel tax on the May 4, 2010 election ballot. Because of an 18 percent overall cut in funding to public schools in California, PUSD faces up to $23 million in cuts to its schools and programs. “When Sacramento fails to fund our schools by more than $20 million, we must take steps to ensure that every student continues to have access to a great education,” said Board President Tom Selinske. “The successes and milestones we’ve seen in our schools deserve stable, local funding so that we can attract and retain qualified teachers, protect college preparatory programs, keep libraries open and continue offering arts and music.” The Quality Public Education Preservation Act of 2010 would levy a $120 tax per residential and commercial parcel each year for five years, with exemptions for low-income seniors, and raise an estimated $7.1 million annually beginning in the 2010-2011 year. All funds would benefit PUSD schools and students. The parcel tax requires approval by two-thirds of Altadena, Pasadena and Sierra Madre voters. Monies raised would be used to preserve educational opportunities that prepare local students to succeed in college and careers; continue funding academic programs in advanced math, science, technology, music and art; keep school libraries open, and lessen the impact of state budget cuts.

Middletown City Schools,2009-11-16T16:17:34Z,4,0,4,0,"Board approves levy for May 4 ballot On Monday, January 25, the Board of Education adopted a resolution ""determining to proceed with submission of a substitute tax levy."" Collection of the two emergency levies generating $14.3 million and $4 million, respectively, per year, expire in Dec. 2010. The original $14.3 million levy cost the taxpayer 13.4 mills when it was approved five years ago. Three years ago, the $4 million levy cost the taxpayer 4.42 mills when it was approved, for combined total of 17.82 mills. The combined fixed-sum dollar amount of these levies, $18.3 million, which is approximately 26% of the MCSD operating budget. The Board of Education wishes to combine and substitute these levies for a total of 17.51 mills, which is less than the combined total for the two separate levies. In summary, the current emergency levies will be combined and exchanged for a substitute levy, on a continuing basis. The original $14.3 million levy cost the taxpayer 13.4 mills when it was approved five years ago. Three years ago, the $4 million levy cost the taxpayer 4.42 mills when it was approved. What exactly is a Substitute Levy? A Substitute Levy is new to Ohio. A district can substitute or exchange an Emergency Levy renewal with a substitute levy. This Substitute Levy is identical to the original emergency levy with two exceptions - as new valuation growth is seen in the district by only new construction, the additional dollar value is added to the original value of the levy. The Substitute Levy is not subject to HB 920 which keeps the dollar amount that the district receives the same each year."

In order for us to feel confident that we have reached all students who are interested in the H1N1 vaccine, the Middletown City Health Department will be returning to our schools to vaccinate any remaining students who are interested. This will also give us the opportunity to give the 2nd dose of the vaccine to children under the age of 10 who received the first dose in December. If you are interested in having your child receive the first vaccine, or the 2nd dose, please complete the reverse side (even if you sent back a consent form earlier) and return it to your child's school. If your child will be receiving his/her 2nd dose of H1N1, please have him/her bring the card noting the date of the previous vaccination. If you have any questions or concerns about the H1N1 vaccine or the clinics, please call the Middletown Health Department at 513-425-1831.

It is important that we have a strong showing of support at this Public Hearing as well as the second Hearing on February 24th. We ask that you do not let this inclement weather deter you from attending! Strong support for the renewal of our charter is extremely important! We are asking parents, grandparents, children and community members to speak on behalf of LCICS’s Charter Renewal for another five years. The best approach is anecdotal, through a short story about LCICS having a strong positive impact on your child, yourself and/or the community (a minute and a half -to- two minutes in duration). Short and to the point is always best leaving the MUSD Board with a positive, uplifting feeling about LCICS. If you know of other people that might speak on behalf of LCICS at our Charter Renewal Public Hearing please contact them and let them know of the importance of this evenings Hearing. The Public Hearing is tonight beginning at 7:00 pm in the MUSD Multi-Use Room right on the corner of Calistoga Rd. and Wardlaw.

When bad weather is forecast overnight, transportation staffers begin checking streets at 4 a.m. to determine conditions. City police and emergency operations staff and local meteorologists may be contacted, too. The superintendent makes the decision to delay the opening of school, close schools early, or cancel school.

Middletown City Schools,2009-11-16T16:17:34Z,0,0,0,0,"Middletown City Schools May Operating levy to replace expiring collections On Monday, Dec. 21, the Board of Education passed the first of two resolutions necessary to put an operating levy on the May ballot. Collection of two emergency levies generating $14.3 million and $4 million, respectively, per year, expire in Dec. 2010. The combined fixed-sum total of these levies, $18.3 million, is approximately 26.5% of the MCSD operating budget. The Board of Education wishes to combine and substitute these levies. In summary, the current emergency levies will be combined and exchanged for a Substitute levy, on a continuing basis. WHAT EXACTLY IS A SUBSTITUTE LEVY? A Substitute levy is new to Ohio. A district can substitute or exchange an emergency levy renewal with a substitute levy. This substitute levy is identical to the original emergency levy with two exceptions - as new valuation growth is seen in the district by only new construction, the additional value is added to the original value of the levy. The term of this substitute levy is continuing. Before the Issue is actually placed on the ballot, the Board must approve a resolution to proceed. This will occur after the Butler County Auditor calculates the millage needed for the district to collect the needed millage for a combined fixed-sum total of $18.3 million. http://www.middletowncityschools.com/administration/schoolboard/:=:https://www.middletowncityschools.com"

Derby Public Schools,2009-12-07T21:06:57Z,0,0,0,0,"At the Board of Education meeting held November 23, 2009, two I Make a Difference awards were acknowledged. Susan Yazel is a current substitute for Derby Public Schools as well as a retired USD 260 educator. Ms. Yazel has devoted herself and her efforts to the well being of Oaklawn Elementary School. Ms. Yazel helps out during enrollment, making phone calls to families who have yet to enroll in a timely manner. As a substitute teacher she works extra hard, often staying past contract time to grade papers and get things in order for the returning teacher. Susan is an individual whose efforts are vital to the success of Oaklawn Elementary. Sisie Holliday somehow discovered that the El Paso health room had a low supply of replacement clothing for students who come to the health room with spills or accidents, which require a change of clothes. One day, she surprised the El Paso health room by bringing in neatly laundered and folded, coordinated outfits, each labeled by size and gender. On numerous occasions since, she has unexpectedly stopped by the health room with more clothing! Thanks to all our volunteers throughout the district!!

San Diego Unified School District,2009-06-05T23:27:03Z,0,0,0,0,"Here is an online article shared with subcribers to School Innovations and Advocacy today! San Diego Unified enters new frontier with Facebook and Twitter SCHOOL INNOVATIONS & ADVOCACY By Allen Young Wednesday, November 18, 2009 One section of San Diego Unified’s new Web site provides an online forum where visitors debate over things like the district’s decision to change its media logo in a time of fiscal hardship. Another area of the Web site provides parents and employees with up-to-the-minute updates on the district’s response to the H1N1 virus. Also available is an event calendar and recurrent messages from the superintendent that include budget updates. San Diego Unified’s new Web site is visited by over 750 “fans” daily, but it didn’t cost the district a penny to build or maintain. That’s because it’s a ‘Facebook’ page, the same Facebook used by over 300 million people worldwide. Bernie Rhinerson, chief district relations officer with San Diego Unified, said he created the page one day last spring in less than an hour. He now spends a couple hours a week updating the site by posting pictures and information taken from a separate blog. “It’s not a lot of work,” he said. “You just upload the district logo and type in basic information and you’re up and running.” San Diego Unified may be the first school district in California to step out into the burgeoning social networking frontier by staking a presence on both Facebook and Twitter. Rhinerson said the district wished to reach out to employees and parents in the 25-to-40 age group who regularly tune in to interactive social Web sites as a primary means of sharing information and keeping in touch with the people around them. “Facebook is a way for people to post comments, tell us what they like and don’t like, and share things with us,” he said. The Web site would be essential in the advent of a crisis situation, said Rhinerson, because late-breaking information could immediately be sent out to mobile phones via Twitter or Facebook. “You need to make use of many tools out there to communicate,” he said. But on a day-to-day basis, the website simply works to maintain a sense of community among interested people and keep them informed on various goings-on around the district. Rhinerson regularly uploads newspaper articles that affect the lives of San Diego Unified’s parents and employees. For example, a recent posting relayed new legislation affecting military families, a demographic that makes up about 10 percent of the district’s students. Rhinerson even had a message for Cabinet Report that we think officially marks the extinction of the printed newsletter. “If you send me your story, I’ll post it to our Facebook page,” he said."

It could have been a description of Springdale's Alternative Learning Center. The ALE does fantastic work and helps students who otherwise would have dropped out of school eventually earn high school diplomas. The mayors said a dropout will earn about $260,000 less during his or her lifetime than a graduate, meaning that person will pay $60,000 less in taxes and will stain our heathcare, criminal-justice and social-wellfare systems. Again, ALE should be saluted for giving students another opportunity to graduate and become productive citizens."

Newport News Public Schools,2009-03-25T13:10:32Z,0,0,0,0,"Sanford Elementary Helps to Break World Record On October 8, more than a million children across the United States heard the story “The Hungry Caterpillar.” The campaign was sponsored by Jumpstart, whose goal was to break a world record for the largest shared reading experience in history. In its fourth year, the Read for the Record campaign took place in schools, libraries, stores, hotels, playgrounds, stadiums, offices, and homes across the United States, Mexico, Peru, England, India, and South Africa, as well as other locations. At Sanford Elementary School, Marcia Binns and Diane Legg, members of the school’s Reading Team, read to 440 children. The delightful book by Eric Carle tells of a caterpillar that after eating an enormous amount of food makes a cocoon and eventually turns into a butterfly. To the surprise and squeals of the young listeners, flying paper butterflies emerged as Binns and Legg read the last page of the book, making the experience even more exciting. Two students won the special 40th edition of the book and two others won stuffed caterpillars. Two teachers received flying paper butterflies as souvenirs. Sanford had a “hungry caterpillar” in the main hallway that grew throughout the day as classes told what “they ate” after hearing the story. -- Marcia Binns Hilton, Jenkins, General Stanford, and Saunders also participated in the effort."

The state’s decision to fund only 60% of the cost of K-12 public education instead of continuing to fund 66.6% of the cost is shifting more of the school district’s budget onto local property taxes. Instead of the planned 1.79% tax increase for the current fiscal year, the Ripon Board of Education must consider an 8.41% increase in the tax levy to make up for the state’s shortfall.

Mastery Schools,2009-10-01T17:06:52Z,3,3,0,0,"Newt Gingrich: So Sharpton and the Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and I were in Philadelphia two weeks ago. We were in a school called the Mastery School, named for the Mastery Charter School System. This school, inner-city, African-American, very poor children. This school, three years ago, scored in the 25th percentile. It was so bad that the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania took it over and gave it to the charter school. They took over in exactly the same building with exactly the same students. In three years, they changed it so dramatically, that they tested this year in the 86th percentile. Better than many suburban schools. They jumped 61 percentile points in three years, with the same kids. So we are interviewing kids. They would say to us - well the old school was like this, but the new school is like this. They are talking about the same building. But in their minds, it's vividly clear- there was an old school that failed and there is a new school that is successful. In the 11th grade 100 percent of the students plan to go to college. One of the techniques that they use is that every teacher hangs outside his or her room, the flag of the college they graduated from. So if you walk through the hall, you are vividly reminded: here is Penn State, here is the University of Pennsylvania, here is MIT. It is amazing the number of people they are attracting because it is suddenly an exciting place to be."

# Purpose and Agenda

This week, we answer the following question: How does ggplot2 work?

## What we'll do in this presentation

- Example viz
- Recap
- Reading discussion highlights
- Key concept #1 - ggplot2
- Code-along: tidykids and ggplot2
- What’s next

---

## What do you notice? What do you wonder?

# Recap

- We focused last week on data wrangling/dplyr, especially: `select()`, `rename()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, and a few other core functions (`<-`, `read_csv()`, `count()`)
- Assignment 3 challenges:
  - Composing (putting together across multiple lines) functions
  - Using conditional logic within `filter()`
  - `count()`
  - Confusing wording
- Assignment 3 achievements:
  - Cool plots!
  - Success, for the most part

---

# Reading Recap

- The importance of understanding the audience ("who") to tailor the data presentation effectively, considering their interests, context, and how they interpret data.
- The necessity of selecting the right story or message ("what") from the data to communicate with the audience, ensuring it aligns with their needs and prompts desired actions or understanding.
- The significance of the delivery method ("how") in conveying the message, utilizing appropriate data visualization techniques and tools to capture the audience's attention and enhance their understanding.

# Key concept #1: `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[

- At the highest level, ggplot2 works as follows:
1. Specify *what* your data is
2. Specify *which* relationships you want to visualize
3. Specify *how* you want those relationships to appear

]

.pull-right[

- Here is an example:
1. I want to use the gapminder data
2. I want my _x-axis_ to represent the year, and my _y-axis_ to represent a variable of interest (e.g., GDP)
3. I want to represent each data point with a _point_

That's it!

]

---

## An illustration

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

ggplot(gapminder, # step 1
       aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + # step 2
  geom_point() # step 3
```

---

## Wranging and visualizing go together

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, fig.height=4}
gapminder %>% # step 1
  filter(country == "United States") %>% # step 1 (again - we're wrangling the *data*)
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) + # step 2
  geom_point() # step 3

```

---
.pull-left[
`ggplot` offers a "grammar of graphics" for building data visualization in R.

Data visualizations are built in **layers**.

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars)
```

.pull-right[

# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Data is always the first layer:

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]

---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Data is then **mapped** to various **aes**thetics (x, y, fill, shape, etc.):

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name))
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
Then, we add **geom**etries, which are the shapes and visual encodings:

```{r, eval = TRUE, fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name))+
  geom_col()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can change the **aes**thetics by **fill**iling them with colors.

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=skin_color))+
  geom_col()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can change the **geom**etries, too:

```{r fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=skin_color))+
  geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
`fill` is for bars while `color` is for points and lines

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, color=skin_color,
                     shape=hair_color))+
  geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[
![](gglayers.png)
]
---
# `ggplot` and Data Visualization in R 

.pull-left[
We can add other layers. Let's go wild and make a *bad plot*:

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x=height, y=name, fill=mass, color=skin_color,
                     shape=hair_color))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,200,100))+
  labs(x="Name", y="Height", title="A Wild Starwars Chart")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# ggplot2 Code-along


.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[Getting setup]

- Download the `tidykids.csv` data in the Week 4 module
- Create a `.R` file for this code-along, named e.g. `week-4-code-along.R` --- and save this in your RStudio project for the class!
- Code along!
- Later, submit for participation credit

]

.panel[.panel-name[1]

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tk <- read_csv("tidykids.csv")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[2]

Can we find the `PK12ed` spending in Tennessee?

]


.panel[.panel-name[3]

Can we find the `PK12ed` spending in Tennessee, arranged by year, with the output assigned a particular name for later use?

Aside: STEM 691 rules for assignment; use an `<-` if...:

1. You want to use the output of your code in later steps
1. You are creating a version of the data you want to use in later steps
]


.panel[.panel-name[4]

Plot `PK12ed` spending over time?

]

.panel[.panel-name[5]

Change the axis-labels, title, and subtitle to communicate a point to an audience of state legislators, lobbyists, and citizens interested in K-12 educational funding?

## Introduction
  
In this exercise, you will use the `tidykids` dataset to explore government spending trends on public libraries over time.
You will wrangle the data and create a time series plot to visualize changes in spending from 1997 to 2016.

## Research Question

How has government spending on public libraries evolved in different U.S. states between 1997 and 2016?

### Instructions

1. **Load tidyverse and the Dataset**
   - Load the `tidykids` dataset from the .csv provided.
   - Load `tidyverse`


2. **Wrangling**:
   - In a code chunk you create below, do the following:
     - Filter the dataset to focus on the public libraries spending category (`variable == "lib"`).
     - Select only the variables `year`, `state`, and `inf_adj_perchild` (inflation-adjusted per-child spending).
     - Group the data by `state` and `year`, and calculate the mean spending per child for each state and year.
   
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Use `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` to create a time series plot of spending trends for a few selected states of your 
     choice (think about a grouping that might make sense and filter for them).
   - Highlight the state with the highest spending using `gghighlight()`.
   - Add a smoother to the plot to see the general trend across all selected states.

     
4. **Reflection**:
   - Which state had the highest spending across the years?
   - What general trends do you observe in public library spending from 1997 to 2016?
   - How does the spending in your selected states compare over time?
